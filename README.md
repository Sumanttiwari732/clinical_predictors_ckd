Statistical analysis of clinical predictors of chronic kidney disease using R
# Clinical Predictors of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

This project analyzes clinical and laboratory variables associated with chronic kidney disease
using statistical methods commonly applied in biomedical informatics.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset
- Records: 400 patients
- Variables: Demographic, biochemical, and clinical indicators

## Methods
- Chi-square test to assess association between hypertension and CKD diagnosis
- Multiple linear regression to model hemoglobin variation using packed cell volume, age,
  and random blood glucose
- Exploratory data analysis, assumption testing, and model diagnostics

## Key Findings
- Hypertension is significantly associated with CKD diagnosis
- Packed cell volume is a strong predictor of hemoglobin levels (R² ≈ 0.79)
- Routine clinical variables provide meaningful insight for CKD screening

## Tools
R, Statistical Modeling, Biomedical Informatics
